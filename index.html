<h2>About Me</h2>
	Hello all! My name is Noah Garcia I grew up in a little town called Algodones located next to Bernalio along the way to Santa Fe. I have lived in New Mexico all my life and have come to love the beauty of the weather and nature here. However, I also found myself becoming bored very quickly hence I began building my creativity. I love building items or coming up with ideas it makes me feel excited thinking of new and creative things to do or ways to do things. 
<h2>What next?</h2>
	At first, I couldn't think of any real ways to use my creativity for a profession until I took my first film class now I know someway somehow Iâ€™ll find a field within film to continue using my creativity whether that's acting or working behind the camera. Now how does this class benefit me? no clue just thought I could use the intro to coding. the photo isn't a place but a thing my car a 2011 mazdaspeed3 and the cause of my money problems. But I love this car and the work and bond I have with it.
